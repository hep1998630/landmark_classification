# landmark_classification
landmark classification project from Udacity

## Project: Write an Algorithm for Landmark Classification


### Introduction

The project folder has the following structure:

* In the main directory you have this notebook, `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb`, that contains code implementing a CNN architecture from scratch that archived >50% accuracy on the test set. 

* In the main directory you will also have `transfer_learning.ipynb` which contains code using transfer learning with Resnet architecture. 

* In the `src/` directory you have several source files. These files are helper functions used inside the notebooks to load and preprocess data, define models, and train them.
